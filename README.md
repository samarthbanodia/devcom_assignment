I Used https://cssgradient.io/ for the gradient background.


The terminal was a component found on yt- https://github.com/JrDevCJ/css-tutorial/tree/main , i added the devcom image and aligned it.

About the main converter , i completely designed the layout from scartch and used the input and button components from uiverse.io for better looks.

I Also added a social media component from- https://codepen.io/nouribram/pen/WNQzoOd

Talking about the bonus questions Button , i customised the component i took from uiverse.io and linked it to **bonus.html**.
